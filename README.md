# Overview
Compify is a simple mobile app that compares different models of specific computer components and displays benchmark charts. When local requests are made, the component information are fetched from pre-structured Firebase tables. As the UI design was prioritized in the project requirements, the UI is made fully animated and responsive to any screen size.

# Compify
 A simple mobile app that compares different models of specific computer components and displays benchmark charts. When local requests are made, the component information are fetched from pre-structured Firebase tables. The UI design was prioritized in the project requirements, so the UI is made as fully animated and responsive to any screen size.
